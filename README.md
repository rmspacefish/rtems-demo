# RTEMS Test Repository

Just a personal test repository to get familiar with RTEMS.
It configured and built the RTEMS toolchain in the same path in
a folder named toolchain but I do not include them in the repo. 

There is a small helper file I use to add the built `erc32` BSP
to the path. It can be used like that

```sh
source pathhelper
```
